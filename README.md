# Capstone_Backend

Capstone Project - Backend
Project: EventConnect

# Installation

** This will be populated upon release **

For now;

- install MySQL, create a database named 'eventconnect' and run MySQL on port 3306
- ensure node is installed
- in terminal git pull https://github.com/MitchellN89/Capstone_Backend.git
- in terminal, 'npm start'

# Notes

Most of the basic functionality is working now.
I'll implement more as I proceed through the front end.

# Todo

There are a few more advanced features I'll try to implement if time permits.
Validation is limited. If time permits, I'll go back and finish off the validation so that the backend is secure and only takes authorised requests.

# Features

For a list of features / api calls. See the routes folder within the project.
